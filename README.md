# Semantic Segmentation
# Using object detection to segment components of images to category classifications.

# Introduction

This repository demonstrates my use and implementation of the fastAi framework to deploy a Python deep learning project. Within this project you are able to see how images from dash cam footage can be used to perform multiple category classification.
